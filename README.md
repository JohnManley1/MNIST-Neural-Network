# MNIST-Neural-Network

This project implements a neural network **entirely from scratch** to classify digits from the MNIST dataset. No deep learning libraries were used, only NumPY. It includes a customizable NN, backpropagation logic, an interactive digit drawing board built with Pygame, and an analysis of the model's perfeormance.

## Project Overview:
This project was designed to strengthen my understanding of core neural network concepts and the end-to-end training pipeline, including:
* Manual implementation of a multi-layer neural network with lots of customizations
* Training and testing on the MNIST dataset
* Real-time digit prediction via a Pygame interface
* Jupyter Notebook for a quantitative analysis of the performance

## What I Accomplished:
* Built a **feedforward neural network** with:
  - Forward and backward propagation
  - Cross-entropy loss and softmax
  - Customizable hidden layer activation
* Trained and optimized the model on MNIST with ~97.14% test accuracy
* Visualized accuracy and loss over epochs
* Created an **interactive digit drawing tool** with Pygame that:
  - Lets users draw digits
  - Shows the full probability distribution of model predictions in real time

## Skills Developed:
* Deep understanding of neural networks' math and flow
* Hands-on experience implementing:
  - Backpropagation from scratch
  - Softmax with cross-entropy
* GUI development with **Pygame**
* Clean code organization and reproducibility practices
* Visual debugging and model output interpretation
